# A-machine-learning-model-for-diabetics-prediction
In this repository I tried to create a machine learning model to predict whether or not a patient has diabetics or not based on several medical predictor variables.  This research has a high-level impact in real world since  lack  physical activity, poor diet, stress, and urbanization are considered to be the cause of diabetics in humans.
